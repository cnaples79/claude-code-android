# Scope Framing

Answer every question before starting research. Write the answers into a brief scope document — one paragraph or a short list per question. Then proceed. If you cannot answer question 1, ask the operator before starting.

## Required Questions

**1. What decision will this research serve?**
One sentence. Name the decision that will change based on what you find. If no decision is downstream of this research, the research has no purpose. Example: "Whether to use package X or build a custom implementation."

**2. Who will act on the findings?**
Name the actor: the operator, an agent, a user. Different actors need different formats and levels of detail. An agent needs a recommendation. An operator making a judgment call needs tradeoffs. A user needs steps.

**3. What does "done" look like?**
Name the specific deliverable that closes this research. Not "I understand the topic" — "a one-page comparison of options A, B, and C with a recommendation." Research without a defined end state expands forever.

**4. What is explicitly out of scope?**
Name at least 2 things you will not research. Naming exclusions forces a scope decision and prevents drift. If you cannot name exclusions, your scope is not defined yet.

**5. What would make this research useless?**
Identify failure modes before you start. Common causes: wrong scope (you answered a related but different question), stale data (the information is outdated for the version in use), missing context (you don't have access to a key constraint that changes the answer).

## Output

Write the scope document before doing any research. Save it or include it at the top of your research output. If scope cannot be defined — if question 1 has no answer — stop and ask the operator to clarify the decision before you proceed.
