# Installing Claude Code on Android

A complete, reproducible guide to running Claude Code on an aarch64 Android device using Termux. Every command has been tested on real hardware. Follow these steps in order and it will work.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, confirm you have the following:

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | aarch64 (64-bit ARM) — run `uname -m` to verify. If it returns `armv7l` or `armv8l`, Claude Code will not work on your device |
| **Device** | aarch64 Android device (ARM64) |
| **OS** | Android 14+ |
| **Kernel** | Varies by Android version — use `uname -r` to check (Android 14/15 use 5.10–6.6, Android 16 uses 6.12) |
| **Terminal** | [Termux from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) — **not** the Play Store version, which is outdated and will fail |
| **Subscription** | Claude Max or Claude Pro (provides the API access Claude Code requires) |
| **Network** | Active internet connection (Claude Code streams from Anthropic's API) |

> **Warning:** The Play Store version of Termux has not been updated since 2020 and does not support current package repositories. You must use F-Droid or install the `.apk` directly from the [Termux GitHub releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).

## Choose Your Path

This guide has two installation paths. Pick one before you start.

| | Path A — Native Termux | Path B — proot-distro Ubuntu |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Quick setup, experienced users | Full Linux environment, fewer workarounds |
| **Setup time** | ~2 minutes | ~10-15 minutes |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Ripgrep fix breaks on every update | Just update normally |
| **Install method** | npm | Native installer (curl) |
| **Node.js required** | Yes (v25+) | No |

**New to this?** Start with Path B — it has fewer things that can go wrong.

**Want the fastest setup?** Use Path A.

## Why This Is Hard

Running Claude Code on Android means solving problems that don't exist on desktop Linux. The full explanation is in the [README](README.md#why-this-is-hard). The key points:

1. **`/tmp` isn't writable** — Claude Code needs it, Android doesn't provide it. Path A fixes this with a proot bind mount. Path B avoids it entirely (Ubuntu has native `/tmp`).
2. **Node.js v24 hangs on ARM64** — use v25+ (Termux ships this by default).
3. **ripgrep binary missing for ARM64 Android** — Path A needs a symlink fix. Path B doesn't need it.

---

## Environment Reference

Key paths and versions for a working installation:

- **Architecture:** aarch64 (ARM64)
- **Kernel:** Varies by Android version — verify with `uname -r` (Android 14/15: 5.10–6.6, Android 16: 6.12)
- **Shell:** Termux
- **Home:** `/data/data/com.termux/files/home`
- **Prefix:** `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr`
- **Node.js:** v25+
- **proot:** 5.1.107+

There is no root access. There is no systemd. There is no `/tmp` in the way most Unix programs expect. The filesystem paths are deeply nested inside Android's app sandbox.

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open Termux and run:

```bash
pkg install nodejs git curl proot ripgrep -y
```

This installs Node.js v25+, git, curl, proot, and ripgrep. All five are required — Node.js runs Claude Code, git is needed for repository operations, curl is used during authentication flows, proot handles the `/tmp` bind mount at launch, and ripgrep is required for Claude Code's Grep and Glob tools to work on ARM64.

---

## Step 2: Set TMPDIR

```bash
export TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp
echo 'export TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp' >> ~/.bashrc   # Make it permanent
```

The `export` only lasts this session. The `echo` line makes it permanent across reboots.

**This is critical.** Termux does not set `TMPDIR` by default. Without it, npm has no writable temporary directory. The install will either fail silently, produce a corrupted installation, or appear to succeed while leaving Claude Code unable to start. This single missing environment variable is the most common point of failure in Termux Node.js setups.

`$PREFIX` resolves to `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr`. The `tmp` directory inside it is writable by Termux processes.

---

## Step 3: Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This installs Claude Code globally via npm. With `TMPDIR` set correctly, npm can stage files and complete the installation cleanly.

> **Note:** Anthropic now offers a native installer (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`) as the preferred installation method. The native installer does not work in native Termux due to SSL library compatibility issues — use npm for Path A. The native installer works correctly in Path B (proot-distro Ubuntu) where the library stack is standard Linux.

> **Do not run `claude` directly.** The npm install puts the binary on your PATH, but Claude Code will fail silently without the proot wrapper. Step 4 is required.

---

## Step 4: Launch Claude Code (Required)

Claude Code hardcodes `/tmp` for runtime state. The fix is `proot` — a userspace path remapper that requires no root privileges. It intercepts system calls and makes `/tmp` point to Termux's writable tmp directory.

proot was installed in Step 1.

Launch Claude Code:

```bash
proot -b $PREFIX/tmp:/tmp claude
```

This single invocation binds Termux's writable tmp directory to `/tmp`, allowing Claude Code to operate as if it were on a standard Linux system. No root. No containers. No virtualization. Just syscall interception.

> **Alternative:** If you prefer not to use proot, you can set `export CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp/claude && mkdir -p $PREFIX/tmp/claude && claude`. This redirects Claude's temp files without proot, but some tools that hardcode `/tmp` may still fail.

On first launch, Claude Code will prompt you to authenticate. A URL will appear in your terminal — open it in your phone's browser to complete OAuth. If authentication fails, see the [OAuth troubleshooting entry](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#oauth--authentication-fails-on-first-launch).

---

## Step 5: Create the Alias

Add this alias to your `~/.bashrc`. Use `claude-android` every time — running bare `claude` without the proot wrapper will fail silently:

```bash
echo "alias claude-android='proot -b \$PREFIX/tmp:/tmp claude'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then launch with:

```bash
claude-android
```

---

## Verification

After completing the steps above, run these commands to confirm your setup matches the verified configuration:

```bash
# Node.js — must be v25+
node -v

# npm — should be v11+
npm -v

# Claude Code — confirms the binary is installed and on PATH
claude --version

# proot — confirms proot is available
proot --help 2>&1 | head -1

# TMPDIR — must be set to a writable path
echo $TMPDIR

# /tmp bind — confirms proot remapping works
proot -b $PREFIX/tmp:/tmp ls /tmp
```

Expected output pattern:

```
v25.x.x
11.x.x
2.x.x (Claude Code)
Usage: proot [...]
/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp
[contents of tmp directory]
```

If `node -v` shows v24 or below, upgrade with `pkg upgrade nodejs`. If `echo $TMPDIR` is empty, add `export TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp` to your `~/.bashrc` and source it.

For a full automated verification, clone this repo and run:

## Tested On

Community-reported working configurations:

| Device | Android Version | Kernel | Termux Source | Node.js | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra | Android 16 | 6.12.30 | F-Droid | v25.8.1 | Path A + B verified |
| Google Pixel 10 Pro | Android 16 | — | F-Droid | v25.8.1 | Path A + B verified |
| Samsung Galaxy S23+ | Android 15 | — | F-Droid | v25.8.1 | Path B verified |

Three devices verified across two Android versions (15 and 16), two manufacturers (Samsung and Google). Auth required manual URL copy-paste on all devices (expected for Path B). Expected to work on Android 14+ with any aarch64 device.

## Keeping It Running

### Updating Claude Code

```bash
export TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp
npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After updating, the ripgrep symlink breaks (Claude Code replaces its vendor directory). Re-run `/fix-ripgrep` in your next session, or manually:

```bash
VENDOR_DIR="$(dirname "$(command -v claude)")/../lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/vendor/ripgrep"
mkdir -p "$VENDOR_DIR/arm64-android"
ln -sf "$(command -v rg)" "$VENDOR_DIR/arm64-android/rg"
```

### Updating Termux packages

```bash
pkg upgrade
```

This updates proot, Node.js, and other dependencies. After a Node.js major version upgrade, verify Claude Code still launches.

### Uninstalling

```bash
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Remove the alias from `~/.bashrc` if you added one. Remove `~/.claude/` to clear all configuration.

## Path B: proot-distro Ubuntu

A full Ubuntu Linux environment inside Termux. No `/tmp` workaround. No ripgrep fix. No npm. Claude Code thinks it's on a normal Linux computer.

### When to use Path B

- You want a full Linux environment (apt, standard paths, /tmp works natively)
- You plan to run other Linux tools alongside Claude Code
- You prefer the native installer over npm
- You want fewer things that break on updates

### Setup — Every Step, Verified

Tested on Pixel 10 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra, both Android 16. Every command is the exact sequence that works.

**Step 1 — Update Termux:**

```bash
pkg upgrade -y
```

Termux selects a mirror automatically. This updates all base packages including openssl and curl. **This step is required** — without updated SSL libraries, the Claude Code installer returns 403.

> You may be asked about config files (like OpenSSL). On a fresh install, choose "install the package maintainer's version."

**Step 2 — Install proot-distro:**

```bash
pkg install proot-distro -y
```

**Step 3 — Install Ubuntu:**

```bash
proot-distro install ubuntu
```

Downloads Ubuntu 25.10 (Questing Quokka), approximately 55MB.

**Step 4 — Enter Ubuntu:**

```bash
proot-distro login ubuntu
```

Your prompt changes to `root@localhost`. You are now inside a full Ubuntu Linux environment.

> The warning `can't sanitize binding "/proc/self/fd/1"` appears during login. It is harmless — stdout works correctly.

**Step 5 — Update Ubuntu packages:**

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**This step is required.** Fresh Ubuntu packages are not up to date. Without this, the Claude Code native installer returns 403 because the SSL/curl libraries cannot reach Anthropic's CDN.

**Step 6 — Install Claude Code:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Native installer. No Node.js required. Installs to `~/.local/bin/claude`.

**Step 7 — Add to PATH:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

**Step 8 — Verify:**

```bash
claude --version
```

Should show the installed version (e.g., `2.1.79 (Claude Code)`).

**Step 9 — Launch:**

```bash
claude
```

On first launch, authentication requires manual URL copy/paste. No browser auto-opens inside proot-distro. Copy the URL from the terminal, open it in your Android browser, authenticate, then return to the terminal.

### Path B trade-offs

| | Path A (Native Termux) | Path B (proot-distro Ubuntu) |
|---|---|---|
| Setup time | ~2 minutes | ~10-15 minutes |
| Disk usage | Minimal | ~500MB+ for Ubuntu rootfs |
| /tmp workaround | Required (proot bind mount) | Not needed |
| ripgrep fix | Required (symlink, breaks on update) | Not needed |
| Install method | npm | Native installer (curl) |
| Node.js required | Yes (v25+) | No |
| Auth flow | Browser auto-opens | Manual URL copy/paste |
| Ongoing maintenance | Re-fix ripgrep after every update | Just update normally |
| Best for | Quick setup, light usage | Full Linux environment, fewer workarounds |

### Path B notes

- **Samsung One UI 8 users:** There is a known performance regression when Termux is backgrounded (proot-distro issue [#567](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro/issues/567)). Keep Termux in the foreground or split-screen for best performance.
- **You cannot run proot-distro from inside Claude Code** if Claude Code was launched with `proot -b`. proot-distro detects nesting and refuses. Run proot-distro commands from a separate Termux session.
- **To re-enter Ubuntu after closing Termux:** just run `proot-distro login ubuntu` again. Your Ubuntu environment persists between sessions.

### Verified Path B configuration

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| proot-distro | 4.38.0 |
| Guest OS | Ubuntu 25.10 (Questing Quokka) |
| Claude Code | 2.1.79 (native installer) |
| Kernel | 6.12.30 (Android 16) |
